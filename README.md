![Application Load Page](/assets/images/Screenshot_20221213_123103.png)

Users are presented with a search bar at the top left corner of the page. Users may type a major urban global market into the search bar, and a list of options will autocomplete, guiding the user to options where data is avaliable. As the user finds their desired city and clicks the "Add" button next to the search bar, a list of selected cities will appear below the search bar with an "X" button next to the city should the user desire to remove that option from their search. Additionally, users are presented with four switches labelled with prospective job titles for boot camp graduates. The user will be given a distinct chart for each switch activated. The screenshot below demonstrates functionality as users select and add cities and jobs to their search parameters.

Once a user has selected at least one global city and one prospective job, after clicking the "Search" button users will be presented with a series of charts depicting median salaries in the selected cities for the selected jobs. The number of charts generated will correspond with the number of jobs selected, and the number of bars within each graph corresponsds with the number of cities the user selected. The right side of the page holds an accordion menu that will populate with an image, summary, and brief quality of life information pertaining to each city selected. The following screenshot demonstrates the page a user will see generated after clicking the "Search" button.

Did the uer love the last search they did but they navigated away from the page or forgot the parameters they used? No need to worry, the last search saves to the browser, and clicking the "Search" button will call right back up the last search you've done. Remember, only the "Clear" button resets all parameters! The screenshot below demonstrates a user reloading their last search. The user is presented the accordion information corresponding with the last cities they searched as well as jobs they've selected.
